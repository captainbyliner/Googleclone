But one unpaid OSAP loan took it all away. <br> "When they pulled all that money out, it was like a slap in the face," he says. <br> "I've got to buy milk for my baby and you've left me with two cents."</p> </div>

				<div class="nutgraphtext">Youth in Windsor are finding themselves overwhelmed with debt, unable to find a job, and forced to choose between staying in their hometown settling for part-time or temporary work, or moving to an area of opportunity but far from family and friends.<br> Windsor has some of the highest debt default rates in the province. <br> Fifty per cent of students who took out an OSAP loan had to either refinance it, or stopped paying it altogether.</div>

				<div class="nutgraphtext"><p><strong>"High default rates reflect both the high cost of education and also circumstances beyond a students' control,"said Alastair Woods, chairman for the Canadian Federation of Students in Ontario.</strong><br> 
					“They can’t help that there are six unemployed people for every job vacancy. It’s certainly not their fault that the jobs that they can find aren’t paying the bills.” <br> 
					Experts say that a disconnect between post-secondary education programs and the job market, and a lack of preparation to take on the debt that comes with training, is leaving young adults without the chance to take risks on good jobs or entrepreneurship opportunities.<br> 
					"It’s really concerning me that we launch young people with such a large burden right out of school,” said Wendy Dupuis, executive director of the Financial Fitness Centre.<br>
					She counsels people struggling with high debt loads and contemplating bankruptcy. She says at least 1 in 10 of the people she sees have some student debt weighing them down.<br>
					When students graduate with high debt levels from OSAP, they have six months until they have to start paying the loan back -- in some cases the repayment is as much as $500 a month.”
					That can leave people with a choice: struggle to make ends meet while paying it off, or find a place where there are better jobs.</div>

        		<div class="nutgraphtext"><strong>There are many variations of passages of Lorem Ipsum available, but the majority have suffered alteration in some form, by injected humour, or randomised words which don't look even slightly believable.</strong> If you are going to use a passage of Lorem Ipsum, you need to be sure there isn't anything embarrassing hidden in the middle of text.  All the Lorem Ipsum generators on the Internet tend to repeat predefined chunks as necessary, making this the first true generator on the Internet. It uses a dictionary of over 200 Latin words, combined with a handful of model sentence structures, to generate Lorem Ipsum which looks reasonable.

        		 The generated Lorem Ipsum is therefore always free from repetition, injected humour, or non-characteristic words etc. Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..", comes from a line in section 1.10.32.
