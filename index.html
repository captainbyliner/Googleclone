			<div class="nutgraph"><strong><span class="drop">T</span>he stories are different, but for many youth in Windsor, it comes down to the same thing: a choice to fight for a future here, or to flee toward cities that offer more.</strong></div>
				<div class="nutgraphtext">Youth in Windsor are finding themselves overwhelmed with debt, unable to find a job, and forced to choose between staying in their hometown settling for part-time or temporary work, or moving to an area of opportunity but far from family and friends.<br> Windsor has some of the highest debt default rates in the province. <br> Fifty per cent of students who took out an OSAP loan had to either refinance it, or stopped paying it altogether.</div>

				<div class="nutgraphtext"><p><strong>"High default rates reflect both the high cost of education and also circumstances beyond a students' control,"said Alastair Woods, chairman for the Canadian Federation of Students in Ontario.</strong><br> 
					“They can’t help that there are six unemployed people for every job vacancy. It’s certainly not their fault that the jobs that they can find aren’t paying the bills.” <br> 
					Experts say that a disconnect between post-secondary education programs and the job market, and a lack of preparation to take on the debt that comes with training, is leaving young adults without the chance to take risks on good jobs or entrepreneurship opportunities.<br> 
					"It’s really concerning me that we launch young people with such a large burden right out of school,” said Wendy Dupuis, executive director of the Financial Fitness Centre.<br>
					She counsels people struggling with high debt loads and contemplating bankruptcy. She says at least 1 in 10 of the people she sees have some student debt weighing them down.<br>
					When students graduate with high debt levels from OSAP, they have six months until they have to start paying the loan back -- in some cases the repayment is as much as $500 a month.”
					That can leave people with a choice: struggle to make ends meet while paying it off, or find a place where there are better jobs.</div>

        		<div class="nutgraphtext"><strong>Some of those youth might have left anyways, seeking university education outside of their hometown, said Sandra Pupatello, CEO of the Windsor Essex Economic Development Corporation.</strong>
										  But for many, the choice was a sacrifice, a decision to seek work somewhere that offered better opportunities -- but with consequences.
										  Nick McGuin was working as an accountant in Windsor, slowly paying off his student debt. But it wasn't enough money to get him and his family where they wanted, fast.
										  His father-in-law told him about a job in Fort McMurray. McGuin hopped in a car and started the drive north to Alberta.
							              "I came out green, as they call it. I had no training, no tickets, nothing like that," he said. "This company took a chance on me. They trained me. They got me all my tickets I need to do this job."

										 <div class="nutgraphtext"><strong> McGuin works as a swamper for LoneStar -- a job he'd never heard of before taking the risk for a better salary.</strong>
										  "When I was told I was going to be swamping, I didn't know what to expect," he said. He works for a hydrovac company, that uses high pressure water to dig holes in the ground around delicate power lines that might be damaged from digging with a back hoe. "It's a dirty job obviously," he says with a smile, leaning against a truck shining after being cleaned at the end of the night."
										  Although McGuin says he's happy with his job, the move was not an easy choice.
										  McGuin lives the cliché; he shares a condo in Fort McMurray with three other men. There are three and a half bathrooms.
										  McGuin works 24 days in a row -- the legal maximum -- and sees his son grow up through online web chats and phone calls.
										  "I work as much as I can while I'm out here. I'm not here to just sit around," he said. "It's frustrating not being able to see my wife and kid every day but we make the best of it."
										  "I try to go home once a month for a week, which is okay for me because that whole week is spent with them. there's no work, there's no nothing. It's different than working your nine-to-five Monday-through-Friday, Saturday and Sunday two days off. I still go home and I enjoy every one of those seven days."

        		<blockquote>If I was going to stay in Windsor, you can't be choosy. That whole beggars can't be choosers. You have to take what's there." ~ Amy Graf, mom with two part-time jobs</blockquote>

					<div class="nutgraphtext"> <strong>It’s a Wednesday afternoon and Amy Graf is sitting on her front porch on Windsor’s west side, smoking a cigarette.</strong> She’s got some time off between her two part-time jobs.
Graf is one of the Windsorites who decided to stick it out in the city — but her choice to stay was not without its sacrifices.
Graf is trained as a social worker and dreams of working full time with an organization focused on the aboriginal community. She had opportunities to find that in Northern Ontario, but as a single mother, she knew it would be hard to move her daughter to a small community far from the home and friends she knew in Windsor.
Graf has two part-time positions that she loves: 24 hours a week at the Can-Am Indian Friendship Centre and six hours at the Windsor Residence.
“I felt really lucky to get the jobs as a way to stay,” she said. Still, it’s not enough to feel comfortable, even in a city with a low cost of living.
